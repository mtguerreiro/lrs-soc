== Introduction
This document outlines the significant changes made to the naming conventions within our project. The primary objective of these changes is to enhance readability, maintainability, and consistency across our codebase.
The changes span across various components of our project, including VI, Functions, TCP Client, and Variables. Each section in this document corresponds to these components and provides a detailed overview of the old names, the new names, and a brief description of their functionalities. This will not only simplify the process of understanding the code but also make it easier to debug, test, and enhance the project in the future.
Please refer to the table of contents for easy navigation through the document.

=== Overview
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) application is the main interface for the user to interact with the control system. It is responsible for displaying the data, sending commands to the microcontroller, and handling errors. The GUI application is built using LabVIEW, a graphical programming language that allows for easy and intuitive development of user interfaces.

=== Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of the changes made to the naming conventions within our project. This document is intended for the use of our team members and any future contributors to the project. It is designed to provide a clear understanding of the old and new names, as well as a brief description of their functionalities.

=== Scope
The scope of this document covers the changes made to the naming conventions within the GUI application. The changes are categorized into different sections based on the components of the GUI application, including VI, Functions, TCP Client, and Variables. Each section provides a detailed overview of the old and new names, along with a brief description of their functionalities.

== Control System

The control system is based on the interaction of the controller with various actuators within the system. The controller has the flexibility to implement different control strategies to deal with the needs of the applications. On the other hand, the controller has the ability to interact with the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to interact with the control system. The GUI is responsible for displaying information to the user, sending commands to the controller, and handling errors.

=== Basic Elements
Inside the controller, there are two basic elements with which the GUI interacts:

==== Control Systems
Different control systems interact with the actuators present in the global system and can be contained within a single controller as shown in the figure <<CS_diagram1.png>>.

Within the control system, it is divided into two sections, the controller and the hardware.

.Controller
In the controller, the following basic elements exist:
    - ID
    - Enable/disable
    - Status
    - Controller interface
    - Hardware interface
These are defined within the controller's algorithm. Much of the GUI interaction is done with these elements.

On the other hand, the hardware is divided into two sections:
    - ADCs
    - PWMs
These represent the inputs and outputs of the controller respectively.

==== Traces
Related to the input and output signals that interact with the controller. The information is stored in the controller's RAM and is listed as the different traces that can be visualized later in the GUI.

=== Communication with the Controller
As mentioned earlier, the control systems and traces are found within the controller. Therefore, an interface is defined to gain access by sending a message to the controller with a command followed by the data.

.Basic command structure
[frame=ends]
|===
|CMD|DATA
|===

Following this same pattern, it gives the flexibility that a control system can interact with hardware and controllers independently.

_Example: set controller gains of PI controller of control system 1_
[frame=ends]
|===
|CMD (controller interface of control system)|DATA (ID of control system, gains)
|===

_Example: set PWM frequency of control system 1_
[frame=ends]
|===
|CMD(hardware interface of control system)|DATA (ID of control system, frequency)
|===


=== TCP protocol/IP in the controller
.Definition
TCP/IP, standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances.
The Internet is a packet-switched network, which means that data is divided into smaller packets, sent individually over the network, and then reassembled at the destination. TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that governs the way data packets are transmitted over the Internet. It is the foundation of the Internet and is used by virtually every application that communicates over the network.

The controller has a TCP/IP server that allows the GUI to communicate with it. The server listens for incoming connections from the GUI and processes the commands sent by the GUI. The server then sends the appropriate responses back to the GUI.

The TCP/IP server uses a simple command-response protocol to communicate with the GUI. The GUI sends commands to the server, and the server sends responses back to the GUI. The commands and responses are formatted as strings, with each command or response consisting of a command code followed by a set of parameters.

So the communication structure with the controller is as follows:

.Low level TCP/IP data format
[frame=ends]
|===
|Data size (4bytes,signed)|DATA

Command + Data
