## Introduction

This document outlines the significant changes made to the naming conventions within our project. The primary objective of these changes is to enhance readability, maintainability, and consistency across our codebase. 
The changes span across various components of our project, including VI, Functions, TCP Client, and Variables. Each section in this document corresponds to these components and provides a detailed overview of the old names, the new names, and a brief description of their functionalities.
By standardizing our naming conventions, we aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly environment for both our team and any future contributors. This will not only simplify the process of understanding the code but also make it easier to debug, test, and enhance the project in the future.
