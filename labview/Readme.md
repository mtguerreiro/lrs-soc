# GUI App - LabVIEW

## Overview
The GUI application is the main interface for the user to interact with the system. It is responsible for displaying the data, sending commands to the microcontroller, and handling errors. The GUI application is built using LabVIEW, a graphical programming language that allows for easy and intuitive development of user interfaces.
